            Boromir was the eldest child of Denethor II, Steward of Gondor, and head a younger brother, Faramir. He was Captain of the White Tower in Gondor and a member of the Fellowship of the Ring. Boromir tried to convince the Council of Elrond to give the One Ring to Gondor, but they refused and so Boromir joined the Fellowship. Because Boromir was so heavily influenced by the Ring and strongly believed that it was needed to save Gondor, Boromir tried to take the ring from Frodo by force when they reached Amon Hen. Frodo escaped and Boromir finally realized that his thoughts and actions were due to the heavy influence of the ring on his mind. Boromir spent the last moments of his life defending Merry and Pippin from orcs, but was ultimately unsuccessful, as they were taken. Boromir's body was laid inside a boat from lorien and sent down the Falls of Rauros by Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli.
