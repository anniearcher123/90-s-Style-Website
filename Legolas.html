            Legolas Greenleaf was a Sindar Elf and part of the Fellowship of the Ring. He was the son of King Thranduil of Mirkwood and was a master archer. Not much is known about his early life, but was an integral part of the Fellowship, using his keen eyesight and sensitive hearing to aid the group. He accompanied Aragorna nd Gimli to Rohan and fought in the Battle of Helm's Deep. He also fought in the Battle of Pelennor Fields and the Battle at the Black Gate. After the war, Legolas stayed in Gondor for the coronation of Aragorn as well as his wedding to Arwen. Then he traveled to the Glittering Caves in Helm's Deep and Fangorn Forest with Gimli. After some time, Legolas helped restore the woodlands of Ithilien, which had been war-torn, with some of his people. After Aragorn's death, Legolas set sail for the Undying Lands, inviting Gimli to come with him, and he was never seen in Middle Earth again.
