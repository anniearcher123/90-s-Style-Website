            Aragorn was an important member of the Fellowship of the Ring given his heritage. At the age of two, his father Arathron was killed by orcs and Aragorn wastaken to Rivendell to be fostered by Elrond. When he was twenty, it was revealed that he was the Heir of Isildur and given his true name, having been called Estel in order to hide his true lineage. After this discovery, Aragorn became the Chieftan of the Dunedain and lived with what was left of his people, the Rangers of the North. When the hobbits set out for Rivendell with teh One Ring, Aragorn met them in Bree and escorted them to Rivendell and then as far as Amon Hen before the Fellowship broke. Following the events at Amon Hen, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli made their way to Rohan and assisted in the Battle of Helms Deep. When Gondor was under attack, Aragorn finally accepted his lineage and used it to summon an army of the dead and help defeat the orcs at the Battle of Pelennor Fields. The final battle of this war took place the the Black Gate in order to distract Sauron's forces from Frodo and Sam. Following the events of the war, Aragorn was crowned as King Elessar and later became the first high king of the Reunited Kingdon. He also married Arwen and had a son named Eldarion.
