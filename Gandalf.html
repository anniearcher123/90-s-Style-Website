            Gandalf the Grey was the most knowledgable member of the Fellowship of the Ring and was loved by many. During the quest to destroy the One Ring, he fought a Balrog of Morgoth and was presumed dead after falling at the Bridge of Khazad-dum. However instead of dying, he was sent back to Middle Earth by Eru, the supreme deity of Arda. Gandalf rejoined what remained of the Fellowship, saving King Theoden of Rohan from Saruman and helped lead the Rohirrim to victory against Saruman's uruk-hai army. After the death of Saruman, Gandalf took Pippin and rode for Gondor, leading the defense against the forces of Mordor until reinforcement could arrive. After crowning Aragorn the new king of Gondor and witnessing his marriage to Arwen, Gandalf sailed Valinor with Frodo. He was the only Istar to remain true to his mission and it is presumed that he spends his days in the gardens of Irmo.
