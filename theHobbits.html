            Meriadoc Brandybuck, commonly known as Merry, was a member of the Fellowship of the Ring, though he took a very different path than Frodo and Sam. When the Fellowship had split, he along with his companion Pippin were taken by orcs. They escaped and later accompanied Treebeard and the Entmoot in overtaking Isengard, leading to the fall of Saruman. He then swore fealty to King Theoden of Rohan and rode in the Battle of Pelennor Fields. Merry married Estella Bolger and became the Master of Buckland.

            Peregrin Took, commonly known as Pippin, was the final hobbit member of the Fellowship of the Ring. He was best friend to Merry and was also taken by orcs and aided in the battle at Isengard. However, Merry and Pippin's paths split when Pippin accompanied Gandalf to Minas Tirith. There he swore fealty to Denethor II, who was the father of Boromir, another member of the Fellowship. Pippin befriended Faramir, Boromir's brother, and later saved him from being burned alive by his own father. Following the war, Pippin married Diamond of Long Cleeve and had one son, naming him after Faramir. He later revisited Rohan and Gondor with Merry and remained in Gondor for the rest of his life.
